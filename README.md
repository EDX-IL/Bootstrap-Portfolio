## Overview

Create a webpage to demonstrate and link to projects which show off (or not) my skills using css, html and javascript. 

### The challenge

The challenge was to 

Create a new GitHub repository and name it Bootstrap-Portfolio. 
Clone this repository to your computer.
Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.
Create a folder structure.
Create a index.html.
Create a css folder.
Inside create a style.css file.
Create an images folder - Place all your images in this folder.

Use Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
A navigation bar
A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use Bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
A hero section
A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
A work section
A section displaying your work in grid.
Use Bootstrap cards for each project.
The description should give a brief overview of the work.
Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

A skills section
List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
An about/contact section

An About Me section in the same row.
A footer section

All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

Deploy Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## My process

I started with the navbar and wanted to have that with a hamburger button on collapse. So i used Bootstrap 4.3 navbar code and modified that.
I also use the navbar code for the footer. I ensured the footer stays at the boon no matter what size of screen
I then added a herobar and use bootstrap jumbotron to display my photo and "working class hero" as pun on hero section. 
I then created flex boxes for the about me, work and skill sections.
I used a flex grid and cards for the work sections. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstap


### What I learned

Better understanding of Git through using it more. Also committing smaller and more often. 

To write / edit the README.MD file as i go. I left it to the end in the last project and ran out of time to do it. 

How to use Bootstrap code. Adding in the template code and editing it to my needs. Adding in the standard code for Bootstrap 4.3.1
I got a better understanding of using Classes and IDs


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```


### Continued development

I need to learn how to lay out things better so they look good and how flexbox, flexgrid and boostrap work.
