### What I learned

Better understanding of Git through using it more. Also committing smaller and more often. 

To write / edit the README.MD file as i go. I left it to the end in the last project and ran out of time to do it. 

How to use Bootstrap code. Adding in the template code and editing it to my needs. Adding in the standard code for Bootstrap 4.3.1
I got a better understanding of using Classes and IDs

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
